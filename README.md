> "Before Bitcoin, there was Bit Gold..."

BitGoldResearch is a living archive of insights, design notes, and technical investigations into the proto-cryptocurrency envisioned by Nick Szabo. Born from the dream of a trust-minimized monetory system, bit gold proposed a structure combining cryptographic proof of work, timestamped chains, and scarcity enforcement.

Welcome to the ledge that could've been. Let's reconstruct the gold that never was.
